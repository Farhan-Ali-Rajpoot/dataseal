# üõ°Ô∏è Dataseal

Dataseal is a secure, lightweight encryption locker designed to keep your files and sensitive information safe.
Built with Rust, it combines strong cryptography with a minimal database engine, giving you both performance and protection.

Dataseal uses AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation, and introduces a unique design where your master password protects only the encryption keys, not the files directly. This makes it possible to change your password instantly without re-encrypting all data.
